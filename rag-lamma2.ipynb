      "Question: What are the chances of recession in US?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the document provided, there is a possibility of recession in the US in 2024. According to the document, the US Federal Reserve's \"higher for longer\" approach will likely strain finances in the year ahead, impacting borrowers and refinancers. Additionally, the document states that elevated recession risks remain in 2024, despite markets pricing a more favourable soft-landing scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the document does not provide a definitive answer to this question, and the chances of recession are subject to various factors such as economic growth, inflation, monetary policy, and geopolitical tensions. Therefore, the exact likelihood of recession in the US in 2024 cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided document alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Is UK out of recession danger in 2024?\n",
      "Answer: According to the document, the United Kingdom (UK) has the most challenging outlook of the major economies and is at the greatest risk of recession in 2024. The document states that inflation is declining more slowly than elsewhere, which means the Bank of England (BoE) will be slower to start easing than other central banks. The economy is showing signs of slowing with job vacancies falling and unemployment rising. House prices are declining, and the full impact of the substantial rise in 2-to-5-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates is still to be felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this information, it can be inferred that the UK is at risk of recession in 2024. The document does not provide any explicit information about the UK being out of recession danger in 2024. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"No\".\n",
